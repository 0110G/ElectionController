# ElectionController API #

## Informal ##
As an Indian, I am very much used to seeing elections
now and then. They happen at different scales, ranging
from a small poll to choose class monitor to the
Parliamentry ones. This API is my attempt to simulate
an election on cloud and pave way for digital elections
in the future.

## Endpoints ##
Refer docs/endpoints




Will be updated in future commits.

# Todo #
1. The design makes it possible for integrating 
    multiple sql/nosql databases. The current version
   supports only h2 database. Add support for AWS DynamoDB.
